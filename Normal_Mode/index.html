        <h2><u>Mark Bolton Design</u> & <span class="monotype">Monotype</span></h2>
        <h1>Hello.</h1>
        <p>Mark Boulton design was a small design studio. In <br />2014, <a href="">we were aquired by Monotype</a></p>
        <p>Over the years, we <a href="">built an amazing team</a> and worked <br /> on some <a href="">tremendous projects with the smartest <br />clients</a>. That's something we're proud of, and thankful <br />for. But, it's time for a change.</p>
        <p>The move to Monotype brings us closer to the <br /> problems we want to fix. Mark Boutlon Design is now <br />closed. The team will be working on Monotype <br />projects from the same premises in the UK and we'll <br />still be writing, blogging, and still speaking at web <br />conferences. We're not going anywhere.</p>
